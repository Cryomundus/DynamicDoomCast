/*
Cryomundus here, added a few A_facetarget to some states since the 
original had just forward facing sprites. It has a full set of rotations, 
so some minor additions where necessary.

Also removed the "bright" keyword save for the death and missile states so 
it no longer stood out as much as it did before.
