Currently, this will just denote all major changes

-Project started: 5-6-2015, little more than 2 years.

-Finally figured out how the hell Project Brutality's Dynamic spawner script 
worked, and began working on my own version, with initial help by Iddqd for the
very basic version of the script, which has since been expanded and refined. 

-Converted Blue Shadow's medbackpack into a more modular version so it was 
easier to dole out smaller amounts and easily redefine them

-Picked out all monsters for all 4 tiers

-Added some bonus items

-Added toggles for various tiers, random, and dynamic spawn choices.

-Added toggles to disable spawning of bonus items

-FINALLY fixed the goddamn map07 line specials in regards to how mancubi and 
arachnotrons are spawned

-Fixed Baron spawns for e1m8

-Added ability to remove inventory items

-added ability to spawn only S-Tier enemies

-(will eventually) add support for E1M8, E2M8, E3M8, and MAP07 

-FIGURED OUT MOD SUPPORT!

-Implemented some minor zscript stuff, mainly Mikk's Universal Headshots and
Lud's Monster Stats Editor from Custom doom

-Fixed, then found an exception, fixed again, found yet more exceptions, and 
repeated that till like 2018, and now made Mikk's Universal Headshots work 
properly with revenants. If Zdoom had just 1 alternative to the +GHOST and 
+THRUGHOST flags this would've been absurdly easy.
