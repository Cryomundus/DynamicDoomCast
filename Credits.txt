/*

Hi! This thing has gone through so many changes and edits and 
rewrites and recreations and-

oh my god I never made a changelog. (as in, when I made this thing 5 years ago)

Wooo boy how time flies.

Well, Let's just say that I've been tumbling this thing around in my head 
and working on and off on it for about, er, 5 years? It's currently in a state 
of WIP, but I'm at least gonna make sure it's monsters are fun to fight 
against and are still something of a challenge. 

One of the primary focuses of this particular monster mod is that 
the projectiles are all relatively low damage, but are very frequent. It 
was primarily down to avoid one-shotting people, as it's rather discouraging to 
lose massive amounts of health because you accidentally strafed into a errant,
random fireball/rocket/comet/nuke. 

This is designed more along the lines of continious play, with few 
saves, as nothing is all that dangerous. I mean, standing still is probably bad 
for your health, but perfectly doable. 

This mod should support most popular monster agnostic mods. I've added compat 
for a few mods myself, notably Guncaster, MetroidDreadnought, TrailBlazer,
LegenDoom, Brutal Doom, and ProjectIronClad. 

Below this wall of text is the credits. I'm pretty sure I gave credit for 
basically everything, but if something is uncredited, please let me know, 
as it was not intentional.

/*  
This is a list of authors whose sounds I
think used, but I've sadly forgotten what for,

and combining them into different forms.

// Btw go check out http://opengameart.org/ theres a TON of neat stuff there

The vast majority of those sounds where modified by Cryomundus

//============================================================================\\

The actual sprites themselves are from(Note: These are all based on personal 
research, and they are also slightly modified from their base sprites)


-BLOOD: One Unit Whole Blood
-Shadow Warrior Classic

-I cannot for the life of me identify where the intestines come from

The "exploding blood cloud" spriteset I believe is actually the Cyberdemon's 
death animation with the hooves edited out. Also, they're combined with the 
crushed corpse sprites from nashgore. Which is by Nash, btw.
